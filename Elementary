HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing <body> tags.

2. Headings and sub-headings, <h1> to <h6> tags, are used to enlarge text.

3. <p>, <span> and <div> tags specify text or blocks.

4. The <em> and <strong> tags are used to emphasize text.

5. Line breaks are created with the <br> tag.

6. Ordered lists (<ol>) are numbered and unordered lists (<ul>) are bulleted.

7. Images (<img>) and videos (<video>) can be added by linking to an existing source.

8. <!DOCTYPE html>, the declaration specifying the version of HTML for the browser.

9. The <html> tags that enclose all of your HTML code.

10. The <head> tag that contains the metadata of a webpage, such as its <title>.

11. You can add a title to your web page by using the <title> element, inside of the head. A webpage’s title appears in a browser’s tab.

12. Anchor tags (<a>) are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page. You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using <a> tags and adding ids to the elements you wish to jump to.

13. Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not changing how elements appear in the browser. Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child relationships visible.

14. Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax: <!-- comment -->.
